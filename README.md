# RetriveTweetsAndPictures
Makes two CSV files of all tweets, separated by text only tweets and picture included tweets. It also downloads all pictures in the "picture included tweets" to a new directory.

## How to use:
pretty self explanatory, but:

1. add Twitter API credentials in tweet_dumper.py.
2. Run download_img_from_web.py, making sure to replace the userName variable with your username 
3. You're done!

_Note:  I'm horrible at python so I'm trying to write a few small scripts to practice, obviously this isn't anywhere near beautiful code and probably doesn't work for everyone :cold_sweat:._
